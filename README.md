# lazy-vicsek

```
- **Let's test out the baseline model, Vicsek in Lazy framework**
- 
```

## TODOs
- [x] ~~Open repository~~
- [ ] Make directories
  - [ ] ./envs
  - [ ] ./model
  - [ ] ./utils
  - [ ] ./data
  - [ ] ./evaluation
  - [ ] ./experiments
- [ ] Create an environment file
  - Less abstractions but quicker! just like before
  - But how are you going to deal with Laziest models (i.e. both lazy listenr and controller) ???
    - idk...
- [ ] Build model
  - [ ] lazy listener
  - [ ] lazy controller
- [ ] Hyperparam tuning
- [ ] Train and save the model
- [ ] Evaluate the model
  - [ ] Average performance in the base environment (validation)
  - [ ] Noise test (test)
  - [ ] Scalability
- [ ] Collect data
- [ ] Save data
- [ ] Data representation


## Assumptions
- Centrazlied training (decentrzlied excuteable tho)
- No noise in training phase
- asdf
